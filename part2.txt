B. Part 2: Essay Questions (2.5 Grade):


1. What is the difference between forEach and for...of? When would you use each? (0.5 Grade)

forEach : A method used only on arrays that executes a callback function for every element.
 It cannot be stopped early with break or continue.
for...of: A loop statement used on all iterable objects (Arrays, Strings, Maps, Sets, etc.).
 It can be stopped with break and skip iterations with continue.



2. What is hoisting and what is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)? Explain with examples. (0.5 Grade)

Hoisting is JavaScript's way of moving declarations to the top of their current scope during the compilation phase.
(Only the declaration is hoisted)

ex: 
console.log(animal); // Output: undefined
var animal = "cat";
console.log(animal);

the second line will be moved to the top and the output will be undefined

(after getting moved to the top)
var animal; 
console.log(animal);
animal = "cat";
console.log(animal);

output: 
Undefined
Cat 

A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible
until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.

ex: 
console.log(x) // ReferenceError - still in TDZ
console.log(y) // ReferenceError - still in TDZ

// TDZ continues...
let x = 10 // ← x's TDZ ends at this line
const y = 20 // ← y's TDZ ends at this line

console.log(x) // 10 - can access now
console.log(y) // 20 - can access now



3. What are the main differences between == and ===? (0.5 Grade)

Both of them check for the equality of the value of the data given but === is more strict and no type conversion is done



4. Explain how try-catch works and why it is important in async operations. (0.5 Grade)

try- catch is fundamental for error-handling mechanism as it is used to manage exceptions (runtime errors)
that occur during code execution. 
It is important in async operations as it is how errors traditionally behave in async contexts. 



5. What’s the difference between type conversion and coercion? Provide examples of each. (0.5 Grade)

Conversion: You Control the Change
If you have the text "100", you use the command Number("100").
The result is the actual number 100

Coercion: The Computer Hides the Change
This happens automatically when you mix two different types of data in an operation.
ex: 5 + "3"
it will turn the 5 into string printing out "53"
